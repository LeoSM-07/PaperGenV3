CHAPTER 18
RED: AN URBAN AGE AND A CONSUMER SOCIETY
SUMMARY: During the Progressive era, the United States experienced explosive economic growth, which drove industrial production and expanded the consumer marketplace. However, city life was characterized by stark urban inequalities, with immigrant families living in tenements while the wealthy resided on Millionaire’s Row. Child labor, political corruption, and poor working conditions were exposed by journalists and novelists. Immigrant populations fueled urban growth, making up one-seventh of the American population by 1910. The rise of mass-consumption society added new meaning to American freedom, with large department stores and retail mail-order houses making goods available nationwide. Traditional gender roles were changing, as more women worked for wages and became consumers. Henry Ford exemplified the new economic system based on mass production and mass consumption, known as Fordism. The maturation of the consumer economy gave rise to new language for criticizing inequalities, such as the idea of a living wage as a natural and absolute right of citizenship.

RED: VARIETIES OF PROGRESSIVISM
SUMMARY: The Progressive era in America highlighted the need to redefine freedom in response to the challenges of industrialization and social justice. The erosion of traditional worker influence in industry led to discussions of "industrial freedom" and "industrial democracy," and the rise of the Socialist Party highlighted the desire for democratic control over the economy through public ownership of factories and railroads. Labor strikes and civil liberties battles laid the foundation for the rise of civil liberties as a central component of freedom in 20th-century America. The era also saw the emergence of feminism and demands for greater personal freedom, including access to birth control. The Society of American Indians brought together Indian intellectuals to promote discussion of Native American rights and self-determination.
